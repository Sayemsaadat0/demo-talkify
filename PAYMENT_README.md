# Payment Functionality Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the payment functionality implemented for the Talkify application. The payment system includes a multi-step form that handles both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

## Features

### 1. Multi-Step Payment Form

- **Step 1**: Email verification (for unauthenticated users)
- **Step 2**: Authentication (password for existing users, registration for new users)
- **Step 3**: Payment confirmation with billing details

### 2. User Authentication Flow

- **Authenticated Users**: Skip directly to payment confirmation
- **Unauthenticated Users**:
  - Enter email address
  - System checks if user exists
  - If exists: Show password field
  - If new: Show password and confirm password fields

### 3. Billing Information

- Auto-populated from IP geolocation (using ipapi.co)
- Editable fields for:
  - Street Address
  - City
  - State/Province
  - ZIP/Postal Code
  - Country

### 4. Plan Selection & Pricing

- Dynamic plan details fetched from API
- Subscription duration selection (1, 3, 6, 12 months)
- Coupon code functionality
- Tax calculation (15%)
- Real-time total calculation

### 5. Payment Processing

- Secure payment gateway integration
- SSL encryption indicators
- Success/failure handling

## API Endpoints Used

### From `api/api.ts`:

- `PLAN_CHECK_USER_API`: Check if user exists
- `PLAN_DETAILS_API`: Fetch plan details
- `PURCHASE_API`: Process payment

### External APIs:

- `https://ipapi.co/json/`: Get user location for billing details

## File Structure

```
app/payment/
├── page.tsx                    # Main payment page
└── success/
    └── page.tsx               # Payment success page

components/payment/
├── PaymentForm.tsx            # Main form component
├── EmailStep.tsx              # Email verification step
├── AuthStep.tsx               # Authentication step
└── PaymentConfirmationStep.tsx # Payment confirmation step
```

## Usage

### Payment Flow for Authenticated Users

2. Fill billing details
3. Select subscription duration
4. Apply coupon (optional)
5. Complete payment

### Payment Flow for Unauthenticated Users

1. **Step 1**: Enter email address
2. **Step 2**:
   - If user exists: Enter password
   - If new user: Create password and confirm
3. **Step 3**: Payment confirmation (same as authenticated users)
